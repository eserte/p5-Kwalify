Revision history for Perl extension Kwalify.

1.22_90
	- change handling of required:no for existing undefined data.
	  Now the behavior is like in the ruby implementation:
	  hash entries with an undefined value are treated as
	  missing, and thus pass the "required:no" rule.
	  This addresses https://github.com/eserte/p5-Kwalify/issues/1
	- more tests
	- enable travis-ci and coveralls
	- don't use YAML::Syck anymore in the tests because of
	  https://github.com/toddr/YAML-Syck/issues/52 (use YAML::PP instead)

1.22
	- cease possible "unitinialized value" warnings

1.21
	- fixed RT #48800 (unique in mappings did not work correctly)

1.20
	- test failure fix
	- fixed RT #48714 (return early if not a hash was given)

1.19
	- allow the new "class" (previously "classname")
	- more documentation about unclear schema definition
	- -h/-help is not anymore "accidentaly" showing the usage

1.18
	- additional checks were not run with type 'any'
	- ceasing a warning if undef was used in enum
	- added warnings::compat prereq for 5.005 and older

1.17
	- documentation change: the URL of the schema user guide
	  changed (thanks to Christoph Lamprecht for the pointer)

1.16
	- get rid of backquote in error and warning messages (after reading
	  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html)
	- protect from blib warnings (perl 5.6.x) in pkwalify.t test

1.15 (not released)
	- include experimental META.yml spec (version 1.3) to test directory
	- new -v version in pkwalify
	- new tests

1.14
	- stricter checks if schema itself is correct
	  (croak on unhandled keys)

1.13
	- fixed bug in range/max test
	- fixed bug in Schema::Kwalify::validate
	- better test coverage

1.12
	- added another test for older perls

1.11
	- fixed another test problem (occurred if
	  IPC::Run was not installed)

1.10
	- just some test fixes

1.09
	- fixed endless recursion when using recursive
	  schemas or data structures
	- implemented -s option in pkwalify (like in
	  ruby's kwalify)
	- pkwalify output now looks closer to the original
	- pkwalify outputs most things to STDOUT instead of
	  STDERR

Revision history for Perl extension Kwalify.

1.22_90	2020-01-31
	- change handling of required:no for existing undefined data.
	  Now the behavior is like in the ruby implementation:
	  hash entries with an undefined value are treated as
	  missing, and thus pass the "required:no" rule.
	  This addresses https://github.com/eserte/p5-Kwalify/issues/1
	- more tests
	- enable travis-ci and coveralls
	- don't use YAML::Syck anymore in the tests because of
	  https://github.com/toddr/YAML-Syck/issues/52 (use YAML::PP instead)
